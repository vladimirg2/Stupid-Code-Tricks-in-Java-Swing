A very simple toy app with what is hopefully a fool proof intutive UI.
Ilustrating the use of input validation and the GridBagLayout.
Developed on windows with Notepad++, because I am actually a *NIX developer and wanted to try windows development.

Compile with:  javac HappyHackingConverter.java

Run with run.bat

And clean with clean.bat
